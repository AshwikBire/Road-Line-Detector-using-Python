# Road-Line-Detector-using-Python
In this project, we will build a model to detect lane lines in real-time. We will do this using the concepts of computer vision using the OpenCV library.  Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in artificial intelligence (AI) that has networks capable of learning unsupervised from data that is unstructured or unlabeled
